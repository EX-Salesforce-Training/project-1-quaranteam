# Quaranteam - Postal Service Application

## Project Explanation and Overview
Team members Cedaesha, Dara, and Xia created a community for use with a postal service app. We used Visual Force pages inside the community to display the information we wanted to external users. The project was based on an app that we had previously built for tracking mail delivery to contacts and inhabitants. We built our community page off the model that Dara had created. Cedaesha was the Project Lead, and Xia was the Scrum Master. 

In the community a user can view a list of all packages and get information about past deliveries and delivery status of a package. They can type in a tracking number and get information about a specific package. They can also create a case if there are any issues with their mail delivery. A user can edit their profile information on the Visual Force page and have their name or address changed in the database. The page uses custom styling to present a welcoming and trusted environment to external users.
